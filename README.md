# INIA International Workshop on Spatial Analysis in R
9th to 11th December 2019
A 3-day workshop with lectures and practical exercises instructed by:
Prof Alexis Comber (Chair of Spatial Data Analytics, University of Leeds, UK) and
Dr Paul Harris (Senior Research Scientist, Rothamsted Research, UK).

Background
Increasingly, research data are spatial in nature, which are now routinely collected with location attached, facilitated by the many GPS-enabled monitoring devices and the tagging of, for example, administrative data with census geographies. Furthermore, there is a broader cross-disciplinary demand for methods to quantify spatial patterns in data, commonly through some kind of hotspot estimation, spatial cluster analysis or spatially informed regression technique. This has been accompanied by recognition of the need to cater for spatial dependencies in the data or the model parameters themselves, reflecting Tobler’s first law of geography (Tobler 1970) which states “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”. This 3-day workshop takes the participant through: (a) core concepts of spatial data and its display, (b) key methods of spatial analysis and (c) a selection of spatial regression techniques and associated inference.
Requirements
Knowledge Requirements: Attendees should be familiar with R. The book of Brunsdon and Comber (2018) will help those who want to become familiar https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book258267 and some links are below. A rudimentary knowledge of statistics is also required.
Technical Requirements: laptop with R v3.5.3 or later installed. NB we strongly recommend staying one version behind the latest release – see https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/ and https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/base/ 
Data Requirements: All data and R code will be provided in the workshop. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own data for analysis during the workshop (last day).
Maximum number of participants: 30
Workshop Programme
Day 0: Before the Workshop! 
•	Session 0: R Basics. You should go through this before the workshop. It covers stuff you should already know prior to the workshop.
Day 1: Data and Spatial Data
•	Setup: making sure everyone has R, is able to install packages etc and is good to go! 
•	Session 1: Reading, writing and creating Data and Spatial Data in R (Lex)
•	Session 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Mapping (Lex)
Day 2: Spatial Data Analysis
•	Session 3: Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) (Lex)
•	Session 4: Geostatistical Analysis (Harry)
•	Session 5: Spatial Point Process Analysis (Harry)
Day 3: Spatial Regression Models
•	Session 6: Regression with spatial autocorrelation effects (Harry)
•	Session 7: Regression and spatial heterogeneity with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) (Harry) 
•	Open session with attendee data
Biographies
Prof Alexis (Lex) Comber holds a chair in Spatial Data Analytics at the School of Geography and Leeds Institute for Data Analytics. His background is in Crop Science (University of Nottingham) and Computer Science (James Hutton Institute/University of Aberdeen). His research covers all areas of spatial data: remote sensing, land cover/use, demographics, public health, agriculture, bioenergy and accessibility, with methods from grounded in geocomputation, mathematics, statistics and computer science. He has extended techniques in operations research / location-allocation, graph theory, heuristic searches, remote sensing, handling divergent data semantics and spatial statistics. Related recent research includes real-time parsimonious modelling upscaling across different spatial supports, decision support tools for sustainable landuse and integrated agri-environment sensor networks.
Dr Paul (Harry) Harris is a Senior Research Scientist at Rothamsted Research. Currently, he is the Principal Investigator of the North Wyke Farm Platform where he provides expertise in Agricultural Data Analytics (https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/north-wyke-farm-platform). His research includes methodological and applied studies in agriculture and encompasses all scales, from the plot and field, to the continent and global. Recent research has focussed on upscaling across different spatial supports, decision support tools for sustainable landuse and integrated agri-environment sensor networks. His background is in Statistics (Goldsmiths, University of London), Geostatistics (Leeds) and Quantitative Geography (Newcastle).
